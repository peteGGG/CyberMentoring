# Level up your CV!
So you are applying for a role, or just trying to get your name out there.   I've seen approximately 400 CVs ranging from seasoned veterans to graduate levels in the past 2 years (I’ve been through a lot of recruitment).  I’ve seen some some good and some bad.

## peter's top CV tips
1. **Write it for an Executive / remember your audience!**
The hiring manager is likely to be a senior or possibly even an executive in the company.   They probably have read 20 others just before yours and they are tired. If you have written any reports, you may understand the concept of an “Executive Summary”, where you pretty much don’t expect an executive to read past page 2.  Your CV should try to get their attention in the first page and make it, so they know who they are going to get, but keep them reading.
2. **Avoid big blocks of text - particularly in your intro**
The Intro or about me, must be concise (use chat gpt to help re-write it to be more concise if needed).  Be care in those to not combine what probably is a bullet point item to a sentence.  Overall, when scanning a CV, a bullet point is easier to read than a wall of text.
3. **Designs/Themes, need to be a balance to presented well vs being a distraction.**  
    Some of the 2 Column templates out there are not bad, but they do not always allow the reader’s eye to scan down the page easily. I find a simple logical layout with minimal and unobtrusive design/presentation elements is easy to digest as a reader.
    
4. **Employment History**
	-   Keep most recent first and more detailed. Subsequent roles could provide less info on what duties you performed.
	- Your Position you held in a company is more important than the company itself. Not all titles are equal, but I would typically recommend the order as Position, Company, duration (or dates between).
	- Gaps in employment can be obvious, but Internships/Apprenticeships are considered employment history. Treat them as a job.
	- Keep your related job roles until they are not relevant in supporting the role you are applying for.

5. **Common tools used for Cyber/IT**  

	> A long list of tools does not context of if you can use a tool properly.

	I’ve seen a lot of Cyber or event IT graduate’s CV. They all like to provide a very long list of every tool that they used in their uni or TAFE study. The reality is, this doesn’t need to be on page one, but as these tools are so common, everyone lists them, so it doesn’t differentiate you as any better than your competitors applying for a job. If you want to keep it, slide it down. Remember point 1 – write it for an Executive. 

	A better way to demonstrate skills could be “High competency in using common penetration tools to identify vulnerabilities and assess risk in systems.” – this is outcomes based of what the tool allows you to do.
6. **Check for Spelling and simple grammar** 
    I cannot claim to be perfect, but keeping these documents spelling free, with good sentence structure and grammar is critical. This tells a lot about the candidate.

## peter's recommended CV structure.
I am bias, but my recommended structure for a CV is to get as much of the first 5 points (from below) into the first page - it will keep the audience (the hiring manager) reading.  I would not recommend keeping it within 2-4 pages (more junior around 2 - less is more):

 1. Contact Details - Name, Email, Phone, LinkedIn (make sure the link works)
 2. An about me - A concise paragraph with no more than 3 sentences on your experience, what you can do
 3. Education - Latest to Oldest - Include progress if part way.  No requirement to list out every unit in a course curriculum.
 4. Recent Achievements/qualifications/training  - Latest to Oldest - selecting the most relevant for the role you are applying for. (If you have a long list, this could be split down in another section)
 5. Employment History - Latest to oldest with at Least Job Title, Organisation, Duration and a brief summary or bullet points of key achievements in the role.  The older the role, the less detail you can include.
 6. Professional Memberships
 7. Work Skills
 8. Community Involvements
 9. Hobbies and Interests (this is controversial, but these often bring in transferrable skills)
 10.Referrees (on request is reasonable, however it's probably best to have your current manager - ask for permission to avoid surprises during a recruitment process)  
 
**Pro-Tip:** 
> **The Length of your CV reflects on how well you can communicate**

If your current CV is longer than 4 pages, there is a high chance, the full CV won't get read.   The document needs to be concise, so summarise large groups of work you have done in the past rather than an itemised list.

## Use the STAR Methodology

the “STAR” Methodology (Situation, Task, Approach and Result) is quite possibly the best story telling mechanism to demonstrate experience. This enables you to provide a brief summary of some of your experience and how it applies to the role. Often we have seen applications where a single paragraph may help explain a single or multiple selection criteria (from the job description form). The examples can be provided from real world experience or academic/training environments.

NSW Government have a great article on the use of this and where to focus the energy: https://www.nsw.gov.au/employment/my-career-planner/getting-a-job/job-interviews/question-types
