# Cyber Security Mentoring Resources

## Welcome
Since 2022, I've taken the plunge on mentoring several Cyber Security professionals within Australia, ranging from graduates to seasoned experts.  I've come to find that many of them have common challenges when seeking pathways and ways to develop.  I have often sent through content to support their journey, so this GitHub repository is a collection of what I have collated and will update live when I find something new and interesting.
